# BlockNBTKeep (1.18+)

Breaking a block drops the same item you used to place it.

## How it works?

When a block is placed and the item that player used to place have NBT,\
we save the item to the block (actually in the chunk data).

## Mainly Used Libraries

- ### [CustomBlockData](https://github.com/mfnalex/CustomBlockData)
- ### [MorePersistentDataTypes](https://github.com/mfnalex/MorePersistentDataTypes)
- ### Still others...
